          Teach with us! Class sessions at participating special collections libraries and archives can range from surveys of faculty-selected collection material to sessions for which our staff provide guided explorations. Bring your class in for an hour or schedule several visits for in-depth investigations of archives, manuscripts, maps, rare books, and more.
